Hey there. This piece of code is created for those starting off with Python. We've got some basic list functions and conditionals. Make sure
you're familiar with boolean, as otherwise this code made be challanging

I was challanged to write a rock, paper, scissors game in 12 lines or less. That's how this code came about

This particular program is made for playing against the computer. If you want to play against a friend, we'll get a code for a that in a bit! 

Current goals with this code:
-Make a better UI
-Allow for the option of playing against a local player (human)
-Add comments to the code
